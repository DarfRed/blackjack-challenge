# blackjack-challenge

I just started learning Python out of general interest in Programming and as a hobby and for that, I bought Dr. Angela Yus "100 Days Of Code"-Course. The challenge for day 11 was to create a simple terminal based Blackjack-Game, based on what we learned so far. I decided to do it twice, creating "blackjack.py" by myself without having a look at the provided guide/hints and "blackjack_with_hints.py" on the next day just going with the guide. Both editions basically do the same thing.

Now I'm wondering: which one is "better" when it comes to code quality? How do both compare, what is smart, what isn't, and what is downright stupid? I'd love to get some feedback on what could be improved or is considered "proper code" or even (especially) if they are both equally worthless (and why?).

Thanks!
